Hello World! If you're running across this site, it's part of [a course at the University of Oregon](https://github.com/eng470-s23/course-info/blob/main/eng470-s23_syllabus.md).

Students: consider using your front page for your white paper, and linking within your white paper to polished versions of other pages. For example, here's a [reorganized and formatted presentation of the material from the project log](project-log-dupe.md). 

For an example of what the white paper as a genre might look like, [check out this example based on some recent research of my own](/white-paper-dupe.md).
