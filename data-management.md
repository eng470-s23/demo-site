# about this file
Based on the [UO library research guide on data management](https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/data-management) and UO's [Basic Accessibility Testing guidance](https://digitalaccessibility.uoregon.edu/assessment/basictesting).

# expected data and formats
*Data may originate from observations, experiments, or references; it may be derived from other sources, transformed, or the result of a simulation. Describe your data file formats. Whenever possible, [use non-proprietary formats](https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/data-management/fileformats) or convert your data to open, shareable formats when archiving data. Remember: data also includes your code and workflow documentation!*

# documentation and metadata
*Describe how you will [document your data](https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/data-management/readme) as you gather it. Descriptions of your data (or metadata) can help you and others locate, understand, and interpret your data. Describe the applicable standards for metadata content and format that you will follow, including the procedures and tools/software you will use to capture and edit the metadata.*

# organization and storage
*Describe your [file naming convention and version control practices](https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/data-management/filenaming). Describe [storage methods and backup procedures](https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/data-management/backup) for the data, including physical and cyber resources and facilities (hard-disk space, backup server, repository). Describe how you will take into consideration privacy, security, intellectual property, and other rights.*

- To store our files, we felt that a naming convention using the class name, term, year, student's name, and the name of the file would be the best way to keep track of the course files. As the course could occur over multiple years or terms, we thought it was important to define which specific course the files were used for and the specific students. The source will start with "eng470s23" for english 470, spring, 2023. The second part of our naming convention is a little bit tricky, because the github has original sources as well as sources replicated by students, so we thought it would be best to use the students first name and last initial, in case multiple students have the same name (if two students have the same first name and last initial, you would use the first two letters of the last name) and if it was the original source posted, it would say original instead of the name. An example would be "eng470s23-marias" or "eng470s23-original". After that we would include what the file is, such as the demo site. Our file name would come out to look like "eng470s23-evap-demosite" or "eng470s23-original-demosite". 

# sharing, publication, and archiving
*Describe what you will do to [provide others access to the data](https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/data-management/archiving). Identify any restrictions on who may access the data and under what conditions and a timeline for providing access. Also describe your plans for preserving data, outlining any changes in access anticipated during the preservation timeline, and documenting the resources and capabilities (e.g., equipment, connections, systems, expertise) needed to meet the preservation goals.*

# accessibility
*Describe your plans for ensuring that your data and project outputs are accessible for users with disabilities. Basic accessibility features include the use of alternative text for images; captions and transcripts for videos; large, easy-to-read fonts; high-contrast color schemes; text content broken up logically with section headers and lists; and links embedded [in context](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/link-purpose-in-context.html) rather than on phrases like [click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ). Be specific about how you will implement accessibility features that are relevant to your data.*
